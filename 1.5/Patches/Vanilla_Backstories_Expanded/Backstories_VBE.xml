                        <baseDesc>[PAWN_nameDef] ran the galley on a mid-sized sea-faring ship, providing hearty and nutritious meals for the crew. Cooking amidst the waves presented unique challenges, yet [PAWN_pronoun] mastered the art. However, [PAWN_pronoun] never took well to the intricacies of the ship, preferring pans over knots and sails.</baseDesc>

                        <baseDesc>When [PAWN_pronoun] was young, [PAWN_nameDef]'s parents were imprisoned for speaking out against the kingdom rulers. [PAWN_pronoun] was forced to steal food in order to survive, and soon became a capable thief. The experience left [PAWN_objective] unwilling to rely much on others.

As a hobby, [PAWN_nameDef] began collecting helmets stolen from guards.</baseDesc>

                        <baseDesc>[PAWN_nameDef] was kidnapped by pirates at a young age. [PAWN_possessive] small size allowed [PAWN_objective] to sneak into boarded ships to steal valuables. Coincidentally, [PAWN_pronoun] also became quite adept at treating scurvy.</baseDesc>

                        <baseDesc>[PAWN_nameDef] was an relatively well-off artist, but the lack of interested patrons forced [PAWN_objective] onto the streets to sell [PAWN_possessive] paintings for a living. [PAWN_pronoun] didn't make much, and what surplus [PAWN_pronoun] had went into more materials and food for some friendly and loyal stray dogs.</baseDesc>

Despite all the odds, [PAWN_pronoun] survived in such an environment and adapted to it.
